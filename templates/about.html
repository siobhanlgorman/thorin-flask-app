<h2>{{page_title}}</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
    when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
    Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
    force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
    rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
    planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King[1], was the son
            of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli
            and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost
            Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves,
            and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.</p>
